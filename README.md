Hello there :D !

In here you can find some codes in python3 used for an university UAS project.

Initial Codes:
- Code to learn how you can detect a color by using an image
- Code that impelemnts an autonomus flight by using cardinal points and saved waypoints, running it with MissionPlanner Simulation

Final Codes:
- Code to upload at your RaspberryPi
- Code to use in your laptop as a Ground Station

More information on how it works and how we proceed in our website :)
